Information on the exportation to lilypond

We use two class :
   - toLily
   - text_performer

The first class will go through the structure score and call methods
of the other class.

When we go through the structure score we sometimes have to know
information on the measure ahead. In order to collect these
information we will use a structur backend. We wil scan the measure
ahead using text_performer which will take two arguments. The first
one is the structure backend and the second one is a boolean which is set to
true if we are scanning. We will use this tricks several times.

In the operator()(braille::ambiguous::score const& score), we use this
trick in order to know if the next measure have a begin repeat bar or not.

In the operator()(braille::ambiguous::score const& measure), we use
this trick in order to know if the next item is a note or a rest. (we
will use here the same structure backend, and we call the variable
"fake...", the name is maybe not appropriate and need to be change, it
was the only variable name that make sense when I was writting the
code)
