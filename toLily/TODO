 -> Duration of note

At the moment we do not implement the duration for the
 note, if the duration is not standard, meaning 3/8 for example in
 lilypond it will be traduce x8.

-> Duration of measure

 At the moment nothing is implemented, if the
size of the measure is not standard the output of the pdf file is
depending only on lilypond performance for measure duration. Sometimes
lilypond do a good job, but sometimes not.
